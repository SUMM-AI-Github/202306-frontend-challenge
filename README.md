# SUMM AI Frontend challenge

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking the SUMM AI front-end developer challenge.

## The challenge

**Build a React application for our main User Interface**

Here you can see a simple wireframe for the task:
![Design wireframe](./design/wireframe.png)

You should implement the functionality of inputting a text in the Originaltext textarea, then click translate and the translated text should appear in the Easy language textarea. You don't need to really transform the text into easy language, just show the same text in the Easy language textarea (or dummy result).  
On the bottom there should be a grid with all previous translations the user did.  
The user should be able to click on a previous translation and the input and output text should appear in a modal where they can be edited.
Everything should be saved in the local storage, so that the user can see the previous translations when he comes back to the page.
There should be also an About page with some dummy text.
